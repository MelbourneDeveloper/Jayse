Traverse and modify JSON documents

## What Is It And Why?
Sometimes you need to traverse or modify a JSON document without serialization or deserialization. Jayse represents JSON as a simple object model with one Record and one enum. The existing libraries like JSON.Net don't do this very well and can be clunky to traverse.
